        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello, My name is Junely Vasquez, and I am a 9th grader currently enrolled at Inwood Early College for Health and
Technologies. I am fascinated by technology and eager to build my skills in this ever-evolving field. One of my short-term goals is to seek out internships that will enhance my employability skills and help me discover my true interests. I firmly believe that technology
will play a significant role in my future business. Thank
you for taking the time to learn a bit about me.</p>
