# Reflection: My Personal Portfolio

** The artifact I chose is my personal portfolio website. I haven’t finished every part yet, but I’ve been working hard on it and learning a lot while doing it. The purpose of this portfolio is to show off my projects, skills, and interests in computer science. It’s also something I can use in the future when applying to internships or schools.

** While building this portfolio, I learned how to use HTML and CSS better, and I got more confident with design and layout. I tried to make it look clean and organized, so it’s easy to navigate. I also practiced writing about myself in a way that sounds professional but still feels like me. Working on this helped me understand what’s important to include when you're trying to show people what you can do.
