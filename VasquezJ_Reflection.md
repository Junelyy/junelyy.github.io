# Reflection: My Personal Portfolio

The artifact I chose is my personal portfolio website. I haven’t finished every part yet, but I’ve been working hard on it and learning a lot while doing it. The purpose of this portfolio is to show off my projects, skills, and interests in computer science. It’s also something I can use in the future when applying to internships or schools.
