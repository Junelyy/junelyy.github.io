# Reflection: My Personal Portfolio

The artifact I chose is my ***personal** portfolio* website. I haven’t finished every part yet, but I’ve been working hard on it and learning a lot while doing it. The purpose of this portfolio is to show off my projects, skills, and interests in computer science. It’s also something I can use in the future when applying to internships or schools.

While building this portfolio, I learned *how to use **HTML** and **CSS** better*, and I got more confident with design and layout. I tried to make it look clean and organized, so it’s easy to navigate. I also practiced writing about myself in a way that sounds professional but still feels like me. Working on this helped me understand what’s important to include when you're trying to show people what you can do.

One thing that really changed while I worked on this was my **homepage**. At first, it was super plain and didn’t really show my personality, but *then* I added some **colors, fonts, and even sections about my goals and hobbies.** That made it more “me,” and I think that’s really important in a personal site.

If I had to do it **again,** I’d probably plan things out better before starting. I kind of *jumped into it* and had to go back and fix stuff. Next time, I’d sketch out how I want each page to look so I don’t waste time redoing things.

This artifact helped me *grow* as a Computer Science student because it made me think like a real designer and developer. I had to make something from scratch, fix problems, and think about how users will experience it. I also went through the **iterative development process** which is cruical for improving my work. I also realized how **important** it is to present your work in a way that’s easy to understand.

If I keep working on this portfolio, I’d like to add **more projects, maybe even some code I wrote or videos of things I made**. I want it to be something I’m proud to show off.
