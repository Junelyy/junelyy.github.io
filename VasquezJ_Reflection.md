# Reflection: My Personal Portfolio

The artifact I chose is my ***personal** portfolio* website. I haven’t finished every part yet, but I’ve been working hard on it and learning a lot while doing it. The purpose of this portfolio is to show off my projects, skills, and interests in computer science. It’s also something I can use in the future when applying to internships or schools.

While building this portfolio, I learned *how to use **HTML** and **CSS** better*, and I got more confident with design and layout. I tried to make it look clean and organized, so it’s easy to navigate. I also practiced writing about myself in a way that sounds professional but still feels like me. Working on this helped me understand what’s important to include when you're trying to show people what you can do.

One thing that really changed while I worked on this was my **homepage**. At first, it was super plain and didn’t really show my personality, but *then* I added some **colors, fonts, and even sections about my goals and hobbies.** That made it more “me,” and I think that’s really important in a personal site.
